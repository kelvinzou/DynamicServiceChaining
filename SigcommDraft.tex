\begin{abstract}


  Middleboxes  are    at once an  abomination    (a  violation  of the
  end-to-end argument)  and a  necessity (for  deploying  higher-level
  services between  endpoints).  Conventional  techniques  for getting
  middleboxes ``on path'', so called network service chaining, rely on
  manipulating how  the  network  switches  route traffic.    However,
  tweaking  the  routing  configuration   is clumsy  and  inefficient,
  especially when middleboxes  need to serve   mobile endpoints or  to
  support dynamic flow migration.  Instead, we propose an architecture
  for  Mobility and Migration  Management (M2M).  M2M presents a clean
  separation of data, control,  and management planes for scalable and
  flexible policy  management with  low   overhead.  We  introduce   a
  Middlebox-to-Middlebox   (M-to-M)  protocol that   leverages M2M for
  dynamic service  chaining.   The     M-to-M protocol   deals    with
  middleboxes as  an explicit part  of the  end-to-end path, and adds,
  removes   or replaces middleboxes  dynamically  as  needed.  We also
  develop update  algorithms to  address  packet reordering  and  race
  conditions during a  flow migration. Our  high-performance prototype
  implementation  can sustain 40  Gbps    on a commodity server,   and
  establish  a session and manage  flow migrations within the order of
  milliseconds.

% In addition to delivering data efficiently, today's computer networks often perform services on the traffic in flight to provide new features, enhance security, privacy, or performance. Network administrators frequently install so-called ``middleboxes'' such as firewalls, network address translators, server load balancers, Web caches, and devices that compress or encrypt the traffic. Recent trends of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networks (SDN) turn the network into a fungible pool of resource for running services and steering traffic. Based on a NFV setting, we propose an optimization solution. More specifically, we introduce and study a new class of multi-commodify flow problems where in addition to demands on flows and capacity constraints on edges, there is an additional requirement that flows be processed by middleboxes in the network. 

% Current techniques for getting middleboxes ``on path" rely on manipulating how the network switches route traffic. However due to flow session affinity and routing policy conflicts, tweaking the routing configuration to comply with a network is clumsy and inefficient. To achieve the routing solution we obtain from the optimization scheme, we propose a middlebox-aware session protocol (MBP) that makes middleboxes an explicit part of the end-to-end path, and adds, removes or replaces middleboxes dynamically as needed. This approach is easiest to achieve in a cloud environment, where---not coincidentally--the need for scalable NFV is greatest.
