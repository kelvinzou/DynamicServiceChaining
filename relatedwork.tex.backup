\section{Related work}

\textbf{Middlebox in SDN:}
SIMPLE~\cite{SIMPLE} and FlowTags~\cite{FLOWTAGS} take advantage of the switches with a fine-grained rule support in software-defined network (SDN), and support network function policy chaining in traditional and NFV setting respectively. Both approaches are constrained by the TCAM size, a hardware limitation in terms of fine-grained policy, and neither not support NF migration or host mobility. OpenNF~\cite{OpenNF} and Split- Merge~\cite{splitmerge} leverage the SDN controller to manage NF's state migration and NF's flow migration. However, since the central controller is involved in both data plane (update the network rules) and control plane (buffer the packets on the fly during migration), they suffer from high latency and scalability issue. They also suffer from hardware limitation for fine-grained policies.  

\textbf{Middlebox using naming service:}
DoA~\cite{DOA} uses a delegation-oriented global naming space architecture, that explicitly specifies intermediary middleboxes on the path. Two key distinction between DoA and \system is that (i) \system does not require any new naming service and (ii) DoA does not support dynamic policy service. APLOMB~\cite{Aplomb} outsources the network functions to the cloud with a naming service indirection. It uses VPN to tunnel the traffic to the cloud and use DNS-based indirection to decide which cloud to enforce the middlebox policy. It assumes the cloud can provide elastic NF service but it cannot have dynamic policy chain for long-lived flows. 



\textbf{Mobility Protocols:}
Mobility protocols use (i) a fixed indirection point (e.g., Mobile IP~\cite{mip}), (ii) redirecting through DNS (e.g., TCP Migrate~\cite{TCPMobile}), (iii) indirection infrastructure (e.g., ROAM~\cite{I3Mobile})
